## Typography

For this website, I have utilized the following fonts:

- **Vollkorn SC**: This font is primarily used for headings and titles. It offers a sophisticated and elegant appearance, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the website.

- **Cormorant Garamond**: This font is employed for body text and paragraphs. It provides readability and a classic feel to the content, ensuring a pleasant reading experience for users.

Additionally, Font Awesome has been integrated into the website to incorporate icons and enhance visual elements.

## Color Scheme

The main colors used throughout the website, along with their RGBA codes, are as follows:

- **#2E2E34**: This dark gray color serves as the background for most sections of the website. Its RGBA code is `rgba(46, 46, 52, 1)`.

- **#6F5748**: A warm brownish color used for accents, such as borders and certain text elements. Its RGBA code is `rgba(111, 87, 72, 1)`.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot (25).png">
- **#E9E9E9**: A light gray color used for text and other elements to provide contrast against the dark background. Its RGBA code is `rgba(233, 233, 233, 1)`.
