## Typography

For this website, I have utilized the following fonts:

- **Vollkorn SC**: This font is primarily used for headings and titles. It offers a sophisticated and elegant appearance, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the website.

- **Cormorant Garamond**: This font is employed for body text and paragraphs. It provides readability and a classic feel to the content, ensuring a pleasant reading experience for users.

Additionally, Font Awesome has been integrated into the website to incorporate icons and enhance visual elements.

## Color Scheme

The main colors used throughout the website, along with their RGBA codes, are as follows:

- **#2E2E34**: This dark gray color serves as the background for most sections of the website. Its RGBA code is `rgba(46, 46, 52, 1)`.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot (24).png">

- **#6F5748**: A warm brownish color used for accents, such as borders and certain text elements. Its RGBA code is `rgba(111, 87, 72, 1)`.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot (25).png">
- **#E9E9E9**: A light gray color used for text and other elements to provide contrast against the dark background. Its RGBA code is `rgba(233, 233, 233, 1)`.

These colors are carefully chosen to create a cohesive and visually appealing design scheme.

# Testing

Various testing methods were employed to ensure the functionality, responsiveness, and compatibility of the website.<br>
 I have faced variuos of issues with my code, but I fixed it using additional sources.<br>
At the start, the biggest mistake was that I was using em for font size. It caused a lots of issues with my code, mostly with responsive design.<br>
Then my mentor Mitko reccomended me to use absolute units of measurement. I tried pixels and the problem was solved.<br>
Then I was wondering how to make 2 round lines around the menu link in the header. Using chat gpt 3, i have founded transform-rotate method and used it.

Information on how to fork a project: Information on how to fork a project: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo">Fork the project</a><br>

Information on how to clone a project: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone the project</a><br>


Difference between clone and fork: "Forking creates your own copy of a repository in a remote location (for example, GitHub). Your own copy means that you will be able to contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository. Cloning makes a local copy of a repository, not your own copy." <a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-in-git">Full explanation</a><br>
